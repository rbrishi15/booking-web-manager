Commitment, waitlist and settlement — the most concurrency-sensitive area of
the system. Covers UC2-04 Commit to Session, waitlist FIFO promotion
(`SKIP LOCKED`), UC2-05 Withdraw and the refund policy engine (30-hour rule,
`awaiting_replacement`, forfeiture), UC2-06 Verify Attendance, and the
scheduled jobs for 72h auto-verification and the forfeiture sweep. All four
exits from the `held` state belong here.
